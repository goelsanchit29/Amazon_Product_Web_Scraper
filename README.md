# Amazon_Product_Web_Scraper
 
Developed an advanced Amazon Product Data Scraper using Python, leveraging BeautifulSoup and the requests library to automate the extraction of key product information, including titles, prices, ratings, and availability. The scraper was designed to handle over 100 product pages per session, ensuring efficient and accurate data collection. By implementing robust error handling and validation techniques, the tool significantly enhanced data reliability, addressing issues such as missing values and inconsistent formatting. The project involved crafting custom functions to parse and clean the HTML content of each product page, enabling precise extraction of relevant details. The collected data was then organized and saved into CSV files, facilitating easy access and further analysis. This automation reduced the manual data extraction time by approximately 80%, streamlining the process of market analysis and price monitoring. The project not only improved the efficiency of data collection but also provided valuable insights into product trends and availability, thereby supporting more informed decision-making. Overall, the scraper demonstrated a substantial increase in data processing speed and accuracy, showcasing a significant advancement in handling large-scale web scraping tasks.
